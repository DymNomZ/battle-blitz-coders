A Simple 2D Game made with friends just for fun and learning purposes.

# 🍀 Map Editor Info 📝:
❗**Instructions:**

**Set an index for each tile**<br>
The default is 0. Leaving the index as is will render it void.<br>
**Use different indexes for each tile**<br>
Having tiles with the same indexes will cause conflicts. Only the first tile with the same index will be read.<br>
For now, you are responsible for keeping track of the latest index. I may or may not add a feature to automatically increment an index in the future.<br>
